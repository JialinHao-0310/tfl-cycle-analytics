1. Data Source (Raw Data)
The raw data used for this analysis was sourced from the **Transport for London (TfL) Open Data** portal:
Source URL:[TfL Cycling Data](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/)
The raw dataset (>1GB) is excluded from this repository due to GitHub's file size limits.

2. Processed Data (Cleaned)
The cleaned dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`) is approximately 800MB, which exceeds the GitHub upload limit.
To ensure data availability, the file has been compressed and split into multi-part archives (eg:part_aa,part_ab...)
Please download all split files to the same directory and extract the main archive to retrieve the full `cleaned_data.csv`.
